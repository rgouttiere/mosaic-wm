# Mosaic — cheat sheet

Menu-bar icon **▦** (with the current workspace number). Default shortcuts below — all overridable in `~/.config/mosaic/config.json`.

## Concepts

- **Tiling modes** (auto-placement): `columns` · `grouped` (by app) · `tabbed`. Cycle with **⌘⌥W**. **⌘⌥T** (re)starts managing the current desktop.
- **Containers** (i3-style, nestable):
  - **Split** horizontal / vertical — toggle H↔V with **⌘⌥E**.
  - **Tabbed** — **⌘⌥S**: one window shown, a horizontal tab strip.
  - **Stacked** — **⌘⌥⇧S**: one window shown, a vertical title list. Can hold tab groups / splits (drawn inline). Drag a row to reorder it, or out of the bar to detach/move it (like horizontal tabs).
- **Preselect** (i3-style): **⌘⌥V** / **⌘⌥H** arm a split (below / right); the **next** window opened nests there. A tint on the focused window's edge shows where. Moving focus cancels it.
- **Workspaces** numbered 1–9 (unique, across screens). Assign a desktop to a number, then jump to it. Optionally **name** them via `workspaceNames` in config (the number stays the key; the name is just a label).
- **Quick-switcher / command palette** (**⌘⌥P**): a fuzzy popup. **"Go"** mode jumps to a workspace (by name/number) or window (by title) — grouped under section headers, most-recent first, with per-workspace window counts and app icons. **←/→** flips to **"Actions"** mode to run any Mosaic action. **↑/↓** move (skipping headers) · **⏎** go/run · **⌘⏎** move the focused window to the highlighted workspace · **Esc** dismiss.
- **Window hints** (**⌘⌥J**): overlays a letter on every visible window (across all screens); type it to focus that window (the mouse follows for cross-screen jumps). **⌘⌥J** again or **Esc** cancels.
- **Schematic exposé** (**⌘⌥O**): a Mission-Control-style overview drawn from the layout tree — every workspace of every screen at once, one column per screen, tiles to scale with tab strips + app icons (fullscreen apps shown by name). **← → ↑ ↓** navigate (2D) · **⇥** cycle · **⏎** jump · **Esc** cancel. Set `exposeSwitch` (e.g. `"cmd tab"`) to also drive it as a schematic alt-tab: **hold** the modifier to browse, **⇥** to cycle, **release** to commit. Off (native ⌘Tab) by default.
- **Scratchpad**: a dedicated app shown/hidden as a floating panel (survives relaunch).
- **Rules** (`config.json`): `float`, `groupWith`, `place` (`column`/`tab`), `workspace: N`.

## CLI

Every action is also scriptable from the command line — `mosaic <action>` sends it to the running app (great for scripts, sketchybar, etc.). Install the command with `make install-cli`.

```sh
mosaic --list            # list all actions
mosaic focus-left        # same as the ⌘⌥← binding
mosaic workspace-3       # jump to workspace 3
mosaic swap-up           # swap with the window above
mosaic toggle-stacked
mosaic dump-layout       # write /tmp/mosaic-dump.txt
```

Action names match the `keybindings` keys in `config.json` (`focus-left`, `move-right`, `swap-up`, `group`, `group-stacked`, `preselect-vertical`, `toggle-tabbed`, `workspace-N`, `move-to-N`, `assign-N`, `unassign-N`, `unassign`, `switcher`, `hints`, `expose`, `workspace-back`, …) plus `reload-config` and `dump-layout`.

**Query state** (for status bars / scripts):
```sh
mosaic query               # full JSON: focused, monitors[], workspaces[],
                           #   workspaceNames{n:name}, workspaceDisplays{n:displayID}
mosaic query focused       # focused workspace number
mosaic query workspaces    # assigned workspace numbers, space-separated
```
`workspaceNames` / `workspaceDisplays` let a bar label each workspace and show it only on the monitor it lives on.

## Status bar (sketchybar)

Mosaic runs a shell command on every workspace change — config key **`onWorkspaceChange`** (env `MOSAIC_WORKSPACE` = focused number). Point it at a sketchybar trigger:

```json
"onWorkspaceChange": "sketchybar --trigger mosaic_workspace_change"
```

Then, in sketchybar, subscribe an item to `mosaic_workspace_change` and render from `mosaic query`:
```sh
# sketchybar plugin
FOCUSED=$(mosaic query focused)
sketchybar --set "$NAME" label="$FOCUSED"        # or loop over `mosaic query workspaces`
```
(`make install-cli` puts `mosaic` on your PATH; the hook's PATH already includes `/opt/homebrew/bin`.)

## Menu bar (▦)
Reload config · Open config file · Clear layout · **Debug: dump layout → /tmp/mosaic-dump.txt** (diagnostics).
